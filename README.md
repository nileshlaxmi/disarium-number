A number is called a Disarium number if the sum of the powers of its digits equals the number itself.
The digits are powered to their positions in the number.

For example:
Input: 135
Output: true
135 is a Disarium number because it equals to 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 (each digit powered to the position in the number).
